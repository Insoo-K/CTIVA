# CTIVA
Demo Codes for CTIVA-Censored Time Interval Variable Analysis

The Simulation Sample generation Code is written in R script. 

If you run the script, total 300 epochs with 1000 samples each will be generated in the data folder.

The CTIVA-demo is python code that runs the CTIVA-ANOVA analysis with the demo dataset.

The demo dataset is sample from proteasome inhibitor bortezomib dataset which is provided by National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [1].

The dataset can be accessed through the link below.
